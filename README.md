# Audio stenography

When running, the program asks if you want to perform a steganography process, extract a text, or do MSE and PSNR tests.

The algorithm works by doing an LSB but instead of making the changes on the least significant bit, they happen on an outer order.

When run, the program asks if the user wishes to specify a file that contains the order of bit modification o if they to use default hardcoded option.

Such a file (order.txt) would look like this.
```
0
00
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
1
3
2
2
3
1
2
3
2
0
0
0
00
0
4
```

Once the order has been defined, the user is prompted to choose among the following options: to encode a text message, to decode a message from a wav file, and to produce MSE and PSNR metrics from specified wav files.

For encoding the program uses the character 'Ã¿' for control, and as such, using it inside a message would result in truncating the message.

While this implementation focuses on text to ensure integrity, this algorithm is also compatible with any encoding and decoding method that knows how to handle the bit implementation.
